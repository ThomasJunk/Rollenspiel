When you travel through dangerous or unknown lands indicate a route and destination (if you’re only exploring indicate a direction and distance, ex., “We want to travel a half-day’s march northeast.”), then choose a scout, a trailblazer, and a quartermaster. Only one person per role, and a person may only do one role. Resolve each in order.

**THE SCOUT**

When you **go off on your own to scout the way ahead**, choose one objective from the list below *then* Roll + WIS. On a **10+** **you accomplish your objective**.

* Discover something lost, secret, or hidden.
* Identify a threat your party is unaware of.
* Gather useful information for the journey: **trailblazer rolls with advantage**.

On a **7-9 you accomplish your objective and choose one**:

* You drew unwanted attention and it’s hot on your heels!
* You were careless, something happened (DM will tell you) and the party needs to rescue you.

On a **6- choose one from the 7-9, mark XP, and the trailblazer rolls with disadvantage.**

**THE TRAILBLAZER**

When you **navigate the way** Roll + WIS. On a **10+ choose two**, on a **7-9 choose one**:

* You don’t get lost. *(Otherwise the journey takes longer than expected.)*
* The way is clear of any natural obstacles — rivers, chasms, cliffs, etc.
* You choose a path rife with edible plants and game: **quartermaster rolls with advantage**.

On a **6-** **none of the above and the quartermaster rolls with disadvantage**.

**THE QUARTERMASTER**

During the journey, when you **take up the rear and manage the supplies**, Roll + WIS. On a **10+ choose two**, on a **7-9 choose one**:

* When you pull from your bag and mark off adventuring gear gain advantage on your next roll with that item. 
* You hunt and forage along the way, gain 1d6 rations to distribute among the party.
* You realize something’s following you because... (do you see it, smell it, hear it, or something else?)

On a **6- everyone marks a debility or loses 1d4 weight in items, you choose.**

**ALONG FOR THE JOURNEY**

If you have no primary role during the journey and are **ready to help**, hold 1. At any point during the journey spend your hold to:

* Give someone +1 on their roll after seeing the result and say how you helped.
* Gain advantage on *ANY* one roll of your own.

DM NOTES: Have each role make their rolls and decisions in order, one at a time. Then build a scene or sequence of scenes to resolve their decisions (try to combine or connect their decisions).
