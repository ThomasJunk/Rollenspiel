When you return triumphant and throw a big party, spend 100 coins and roll +1 for every extra 100 coins spent. 

✴On a 10+, choose 3. 
✴On a 7–9, choose 1. 
✴On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really out of hand (the GM will say how).

- You befriend a useful NPC.
- You hear rumors of an opportunity.
- You gain useful information.
- You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked.
