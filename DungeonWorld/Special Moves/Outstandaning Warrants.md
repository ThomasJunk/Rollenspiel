When you return to a civilized place in which you’ve caused trouble before, roll+Cha.

✴On a 10+, word has spread of your deeds and everyone recognizes you. 
✴On a 7–9, as above, and the GM chooses a complication:
- The local constabulary has a warrant out for your arrest.
- Someone has put a price on your head.
- Someone important to you has been put in a bad spot as a result of your actions.
